My name is Leonardo, I study mathematics at University of Trento and I think I will enjoy talking about maths in the future - although I have no idea how. 
One chance could be [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1l67JZBNiNEA2cb8M1fbQ), or maybe writing books, who knows.

My apologies if the content of this website is mostly in Italian, but it would be quite the hustle to translate it all! I could do it some time in the future.

I generate lots of plans and sometimes some of them even work. After all, there is too much to do in too little time.

Don't listen to those nasty rapscallions going around telling I am a supervillain, lies and deceptions! What, that villain-ish portrait? It's not mine, how did it even get there?
